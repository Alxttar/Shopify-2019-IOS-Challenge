# 2019 Shopify Internship iOS Code Challenge 

Here is my take on the word search game challenge. The game has a custom grid size where user can select the size of the grid between 10 and 15. I also implemented the random word placement on the grid. the placement of the words is in 5 direction. from right to left, left to right, up, down, and in diagonal.

The user can select the words he found swiping on them. We keep track of the score and annonce the game is over and if we want to play again.

Hope you Enjoy!
